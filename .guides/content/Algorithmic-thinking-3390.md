Algorithmic thinking is  subset of computational thinking that involves defining a clear set of instructions to solve a problem.
Once a successful solution to  problem has been found, it can be used repeatedly for the 
same problem.

An algorithm is  step-by-step procedure for solving  problem or carrying out a task.
The instructions must be unambiguous - this means that the instructions cannot be misunderstood and the correct action will always be performed. All instructions given to a computer must be unambiguous or it won’t do anything!

There are two criteria for deciding whether an algorithm is successful:

- **Accuracy** – it must lead to the expected outcome each time it is run.
- **Efficiency** - it must solve the problem in the shortest possible time using the least amount of computer resources.
