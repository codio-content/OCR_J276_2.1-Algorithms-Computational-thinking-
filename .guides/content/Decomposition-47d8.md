Decomposition means breaking a problem down into smaller, more manageable parts which are then easier to solve. 
It is an example of a ‘divide and conquer’ technique – it is easier to solve lots of smaller problems than one large one.
As smaller algorithms are developed for each sub-problem, it is easier to spot and correct errors and when the algorithm is developed into a program, code can be reused.

It also enables different individuals or groups to work on different sub-problems at the same time. 

In section 2.6, lesson 4 you were shown how to convert numbers between denary, binary and hexadecimal. This definitely needs decomposition into smaller parts such as:

1. Allow user to select number system for entry.
1. Allow user to enter number and validate - denary number is 255 or less, a binary number has only 8 digits which are 1s and/or 0s and hexadecimal numbers have two digits which are in the range 0 to 9 or A to F.
1. Convert denary to binary and vice versa.
1. Convert denary to hexadecimal and vice versa.
1. Convert binary to hexadecimal and vice versa.
1. User interface and display of results.

The decomposition will show where subprograms can be used e.g. a function to convert a binary number into a denary one, a denary number into a hexadecimal one etc.
