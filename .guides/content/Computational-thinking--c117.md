In this lesson we will look at computational thinking which involves the processes of decomposing, abstraction and algorithmic thinking.

The role of a computer scientist is to:

- Define and analyse problems.
- Create structured solutions â€“ algorithms.
- Code the solutions into a form that can be implemented by a computer.

The first two tasks make up what is known as computational thinking. The third task is something that is done to implement the solution to convert it into a computer-friendly version.
