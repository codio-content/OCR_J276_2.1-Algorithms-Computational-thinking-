In an algorithm you could design a function to draw a rectangle on screen. It could have a fixed length and width or it could be user entered.
You could also design a function to draw a triangle.

Now every time you want to draw an on-screen rectangle or triangle you do not have to go through all the lines of code. 
All you have to do is call the ‘rectangle’ or ‘triangle’ functions. You do not need to know the details of the code to do it only the name of the function to call. Abstraction saves time!

If you wanted to draw a house all you would need are the two functions and combine them into another function named ’’house’. And that could be repeated many times in a function called ‘city’.

Similarly in high level languages when we use a function like ‘print’ we do not need to know all the code required to make the output appear on screen. It is all contained within the function and we are allowed to be at a high level of abstraction from it.

When we are programming in high level languages we can import large libraries of functions that other have created to carry out tasks we require. We do not need to know how they work, just how to use them.
This is the power of abstraction.
