We use abstraction all of the time in our daily lives as abstraction is concerned with the amount of detail we need to bother about in each situation. And which details we need and which we don’t. It’s all about managing complexity.

We abstract the essential features of something so that we can understand what people are trying to communicate.

For example, if you were walking down the street and saw one of these you would tell people that you had seen a ‘cat’.
They would immediately know what you meant – a small animal, with fur, four legs, a tail and a purr.
That is because we abstract the basic features and make a mental image of a cat.
These are the only details we need to consider in this situation.
What the listeners picture may not be exactly like the cat the person saw and each listener may imagine a different cat. But that doesn’t matter. They all picture the same type of animal.

Imagine what it would be like without abstraction. Having to explain everything in the minutest detail every time you talked to somebody! The person couldn’t even say “I saw an animal” without having to explain what an animal is!

But in a different situation that amount of detail may not be enough. Less abstraction is needed.

If the person had lost their cat it wouldn’t do much good just saying “I have lost my cat. Please help me find it”.

They would have to include far more details such as colour, height, gender and distinguishing marks.

If you are writing an algorithm to model a game that requires the throw of a dice you could write a sub program to simulate it.
You would have to use your powers of abstraction to identify the key features required.
For the computer game the colour of the dice and the material it is made from are totally unimportant. The essential feature is the ability to return a random number between 1 and 6.
This could be coded into a function which could be called when needed.
